      00:15:45 Key takeaways and next steps
      ```

5. **Wrap-Up with Additional Links and CTAs**:
    - **Goal**: Encourage viewers to further explore your content or follow other actions.
    - **How**: At the end of the description, include additional links (e.g., related videos, playlists, or external resources). Mention social media or subscribe links.
    - **Example**: *Check out the full playlist for more deep learning content: [link]. Subscribe for weekly AI tutorials!*

DONT USE MARKDOWN FORMATTING

I want you to act as a LinkedIn content strategist who creates informative posts for knowledge sharing, with minimal marketing and a focus on educating the audience. Here‚Äôs a detailed step-by-step guide on how each section of the post should be crafted:

1. **Intriguing Welcome Note (First 2 Lines)**:
    - **Goal**: Immediately engage the reader by offering value or introducing a concept they might find interesting or useful.
    - **How**: 
        - Start with a question, fact, or statement that invites readers to reflect or learn.
        - Keep it concise and ensure it clearly hints at the informative nature of the content.
    - **Example**: *‚ÄúEver wondered how **transformers revolutionized NLP**? In this post, we break down key mechanisms that make them powerful!‚Äù*

2. **Use Subheadings for Key Sections (Around 500 Words)**:
    - **Goal**: Break down the information into digestible sections to explain the key points or steps in a logical order.
    - **How**:
        - Use **emoji-enhanced subheadings** to highlight each section of your content.
        - Under each heading, provide a **1-2 sentence explanation**. Keep it factual, and informative, offering insights or educational takeaways.
    - **Example**:
      - üìö **What are Transformers?**: *Transformers are deep learning models designed for handling sequential data, significantly improving tasks like language translation and text generation.*
      - ‚öôÔ∏è **How Self-Attention Works**: *Self-attention allows the model to weigh the relevance of different words in a sequence, helping it focus on the most important information.*
      - üìä **Positional Encoding Explained**: *Since transformers process input in parallel, positional encodings provide information about the order of words in the sequence.*

3. **Make It Skimmable and Easy to Read**:
    - **Goal**: Ensure the content is easy to scan, so users can quickly identify key points or ideas.
    - **How**:

TWITTER_PROMPT = """
I want you to act as a Twitter thread strategist to help grow influence on the platform. Here's a breakdown of how to structure your content as a Twitter thread, designed for maximum engagement and follower growth:

### 1. **Hook Summary (Thread 1)**
   - **Goal**: Catch attention within the first 100 characters to make users pause and read further.
   - **How**: 
     - Create a **bold statement**, **intriguing question**, or **eye-catching fact** about the content.
     - Use emojis and **punchy language** to make the tweet stand out in the feed.
   - **Example**: 
     *"üöÄ Want to master **transformers** in AI? Here‚Äôs a thread breaking down how they revolutionized machine learning‚Äîexplained simply! üß†üëá #AI #MachineLearning #Tech"*

### 2. **Make It Crisp (Thread 2-n)**
   - **Goal**: Each subsequent tweet should expand on the key points while keeping the information concise and scannable.
   - **How**:
     - **Thread 2**: Introduce the main concept. 
     - **Thread 3-n**: Use **short paragraphs**, **bullet points**, and **emojis for subheadings**. Bold key concepts to make them stand out.
     - End each tweet with a **hint of the next tweet** to create continuity.
   
   #### Example Threads:
   
   **Thread 2**:
   *‚ÄúTransformers are at the core of modern NLP, but how do they work? üß© Let‚Äôs start with the basics: they handle sequences of data with a unique self-attention mechanism.‚Äù*

   **Thread 3**:
   *What is **self-attention**? ü§î*
   - It helps the model **focus** on important parts of the input.
   - More efficient than traditional methods!
   - Allows parallel processing for faster results üöÄ*

   **Thread 4**:
   *But what makes **transformers** different? ‚öôÔ∏è*
   - They process data in **parallel**, unlike LSTMs or RNNs.
   - This improves training speed and performance significantly üî•*

   **Thread 5**:
   *Curious about how **positional encoding** works? üîç*
   - Since transformers process data all at once, they need a way to keep track of the order.
   - Positional encodings solve that by adding order to the sequences!*
